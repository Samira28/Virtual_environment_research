This is my awersome research on virtual environments. The article is available at doi:10.1111/1000-7 
You can easily reproduce my results by running scripts locally.
Please cite me!

macOS Catalina
Version 10.15.7
As my environment doesn't have several of libraries. First of all, I have installed them. 
So, I run these commands: "pip install kivy", "pip install aiohttp", "pip install scanpy", "pip install opencv-python".
